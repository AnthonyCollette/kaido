Every year, during the harvest season, our experts carefully select the argan nuts by hand. These fruits, rich in pulp, hide the precious kernels that contain argan oil with its exceptional properties.",
            "desc_2": "The nuts are harvested using a traditional technique handed down from generation to generation. Berber women, guardians of this ancestral knowledge, master the delicate art of nut extraction, preserving the quality of the oil.",
            "desc_3": "Our commitment to sustainability guides every step of the process. Nuts are harvested in a way that respects the region's fragile ecosystem, and our local partners are encouraged to adopt responsible farming practices.",
            "desc_4": "The selected argan nuts are then cold-pressed, a method that preserves the integrity of the essential fatty acids and precious nutrients present in the oil. This process guarantees optimum quality and maximum concentration of benefits.",
            "desc_5": "Beyond harvesting, our approach is based on fair trade. By working closely with local cooperatives, we contribute to the well-being of communities by ensuring fair working conditions and shared benefits."
